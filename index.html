<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Photo metadata is key to protecting images' copyright and licensing information online. It is also essential for managing digital assets. Detailed and accurate descriptions about images ensure they can be easily and efficiently retrieved via search, by users or machine-readable code. This results in smoother workflow within organizations, more precise tracking of images, and increased licensing opportunities.
Therefore, photo metadata is critical to photo and related business. IPTC has specified metadata to meet these needs; it is the industry standard of professional photography.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_how_iptc_photo_metadata_evolved_over_time">How IPTC Photo Metadata Evolved Over Time</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IPTC - www.iptc.org - is a body of content providers and system vendors from the news industry and has defined standards for metadata about news since 1979. Since the mid 1990’s IPTC metadata are have been quite popular for photos as they were adopted by Adobe Photoshop at this time. The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard defining the Core and Extension metadata schemas is the second generation of IPTC photo metadata.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPTC’s older standard for metadata, the Information Interchange Model (IIM), was issued in 1991 and defined a set of metadata properties and a data format to embed the metadata values into image files. In the early nineties a subset of this IIM was adopted as the well-known “IPTC Fields” by Adobe Photoshop and can be embedded into JPEG, TIFF and PSD files since then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the early 2000-years a new technology for embedding metadata into image files was invented. It is called XMP, was developed by Adobe and is now an ISO standard. This technology required defining new technical specifications for the well-known “IPTC Fields” of the IIM standard and this was done by the IPTC Core schema which was initially released in 2005 and has evolved to version 1.2 since then. A key feature in the transition to IPTC Core in XMP was that the definition of the purpose and the specified use of an IIM field should remain the same, with only the underlying technical details changed. As the IPTC Core is in fact a mirror of the IIM fields it will no longer be extended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussion of IPTC Core raised the need for additional metadata properties not covered by the IIM standard. IPTC created the IPTC Extension schema in 2008. IPTC Extension has been updated twice and is since November 2014 at version 1.2. Any future additions to the IPTC Photo Metadata will be part of the IPTC Extension schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After development over two decades IPTC Photo Metadata can be embedded in the following ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>IPTC Core fields can be embedded in the IIM format and/or in the XMP format. A key challenge for metadata embedded in parallel in IIM and XMP is that the values are synchronised – this should be taken care of by the image management software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IPTC Extension fields can be embedded only in XMP format.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To help users, the IPTC collects information from software vendors on their support for IPTC Photo Metadata. Find out more at www.iptc.org/photometadata.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be aware that IPTC Core and IPTC Extension fields can be saved as XMP “sidecar files” for camera Raw files and those file formats which do not support embedded metadata.</p>

<h3 id="_photo_metadata_under_the_hood">Photo Metadata - Under the Hood</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Photo metadata has to be processed by software under the hood of panels on your computer screen. See below how this is done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram shows the flow of metadata values from an input panel on your computer screen into an image file and the way back from an image file to their display on the panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_you_see_on_your_computer_screen">What you see on your computer screen</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the left, the diagram shows a metadata input panel for IPTC fields in your software, only a few fields are shown here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_inside_imaging_software_on_your_computer">Inside imaging software on your computer</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the centre, the diagram shows how your software handles the metadata. The software creates a temporary internal structure to support the data in both IIM (in blue) and XMP (in red) formats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see from the orange arrows that some field values are transferred to both the IIM and the XMP structures (Creator and Description) and others only to the XMP structure (Persons Shown and Digital Source Type). Fields added to the IPTC Photo Metadata specification’s Extension Schema (after 2005) exist only in XMP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As some fields are replicated in IIM and XMP, the software has to keep these values in synch (dotted lines). This is less an issue for data transferred from the input panel than for data read from an image file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_inside_your_jpeg_image_file">Inside your JPEG image file</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the right you see the structure of an image file with sections for metadata (headers) and a section for image data (the pixels). The diagram shows that the IIM and XMP data structures are stored in two different headers. In a JPEG file the headers are of type APP1 and APP13 and they may have additional internal identifiers for the metadata formats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data structures are embedded into the headers using different technical formats:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>IIM is a sequence of bytes, where each field has a numeric identifier (2:80 and 2:120)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XMP is a single (long) text string using XML as markup language, typically using angle brackets &lt;&gt; as delimiters. Fields are identified by strings like dc:creator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The green arrows show how data from the internal software structure is embedded in the headers of the image file. If this file is copied to another computer, then exactly this set of embedded bytes takes the metadata to the new location.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_metadata_from_the_image_file_to_your_screen_panel">Metadata from the image file to your screen panel</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data embedded in the image file can be read by software, so the process also works from right to left on the diagram, as shown by the bi-directional arrows. The software reads from the metadata headers and stores the information in its internal structures. The software has to verify that the IIM and XMP values are the same; if they are not, there are rules about which value should take precedence. At the end of this process IIM and XMP values are the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The values are then displayed on the panel on your computer screen and are ready for editing. Pressing Save, sends the data back to the image file for embedding as before.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section groups metadata fields according to information type.
General Image Content</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key use of metadata is to describe the content of an image. This can be done in two basic ways:
•	Using standard terms from value lists or controlled vocabularies.
Choosing terms from a standard list of values enables easier and more consistent search within a single collection or across collections. Controlled vocabularies are one form of value list.
•	Using free-text (natural language)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> Read also about metadata for specific content on pages about persons,  locations or other things (organisations, events, products, artwork, objects).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keyword
Enter keywords to describe the visible and abstract content of the photograph.  Keywords are in free text form, and may be single or compound terms.
Keywords are descriptive words added to an image to enable search and retrieval. They describe what is visible in the image and concepts associated with the image. Keywords are expressed as a list of terms. Keywords can be single or compound terms.
Values from the controlled vocabulary IPTC Subject Codes should be placed into the “Subject Code” field.
 BE AWARE: Keywords may have to be separated by commas or other separators depending on the software. The field for each keyword is limited by the IIM format to about 64 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPTC Subject Code
This field can be used to specify and categorise the content of a photograph by using one or more subjects as listed in the IPTC “Subject NewsCodes” taxonomy (available from <a href="http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/subjectcode" class="bare">http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/subjectcode</a>). Each subject term is represented as a code of 8 digits in an unordered list. Only subjects from this controlled vocabulary should be used in this field, free text keywords should be entered into the Keyword field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CV-Term About the Image
This field structure is a generic way to add one or more terms, themes or named entities to describe the image.
Multiple terms may be used; each term must be taken from an identified Controlled Vocabulary. Terms may be from different Controlled Vocabularies.
This CV field enables users to enter terms about the image from specific controlled vocabularies. Terms from one or more vocabularies may be entered. The structure is:
•	CV Term Name
taken from a Controlled Vocabulary
•	CV Term ID
Unique identifier for the term in the Controlled Vocabulary.
•	CV ID
Unique identifier for the Controlled Vocabulary (often a URL).
•	Refined “About”
Optional: globally Unique identifier for a concept refining the ‘about’ relationship between the image and the CV term. Example: the concept could stand for emotions shown by persons in the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intellectual Genre
Globally unique identifier for controlled terms to describe the genre of the photo. The IPTC Genre vocabulary may be used <a href="http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/genre" class="bare">http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/genre</a> or other genre vocabularies more focused on photography.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Genre (generic)
This field structure is a generic way to describe the genre of the photo with a value from any Controlled Vocabulary. (The Intellectual Genre actively supports only the use of an IPTC vocabulary.)
Multiple genre terms may be used; each term must be taken from an identified Controlled Vocabulary.
Genre Terms from one or more vocabularies may be entered. The structure is:
•	CV Term Name
taken from a Controlled Vocabulary
•	CV Term ID
Unique identifier for the term in the Controlled Vocabulary.
•	CV ID
Unique identifier for the Controlled Vocabulary (often a URL).
•	Refined “About”
Optional: globally Unique identifier for a concept refining the kind of genre CV this term originates from. Example: the used genre CV is providing terms of journalistic genres, product genres, usage genres, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPTC Scene Code
This field is used to describe the scene of a photo using one or more terms from the IPTC "Scene-NewsCodes". You should only enter values from the IPTC Scene controlled vocabulary (available from <a href="http://www.newscodes.org" class="bare">http://www.newscodes.org</a> and <a href="http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene" class="bare">http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene</a>). Each IPTC Scene term is represented as a 6 digit numerical string in an unordered list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Image Rating
Many professional photo applications have had a image rating feature for some time. These are typically shown as star ratings within a collection and are used to indicate the quality of an image; typically giving one star for entry-level photos, and reserving the higher numbered values for more special or unique images. Assigning a star rating as part of a workflow will make it easier to quickly find, sort, or filter out more valuable images from a grouping at a later point in time.
Photographers may use a method where any ‘keepers’ from an assignment are given one star during an initial review. On a second pass they may give a two-star rating to those images deemed superior, or even three stars for those that are outstanding. These values may differ from what an agency or distributor uses, so they may be overwritten or re-evaluated. Some editors recommend that you think of this as a pyramid, with a 10 to 1 ratio between each level. This method will ensure you won’t end up with too many ‘special’ photos in a collection.
To make sure you consistently apply the same image rating criteria each time, write down your rationale. Then put this text somewhere you can refer to each time you are editing.
Here is one photographer&#8217;s image rating rationale as an example:
-	0 stars = record shots, or don&#8217;t delete immediately (fall back images)
-	* = Entry level threshold achieved (in focus, exposure within reason)
-	<strong> = Best shot from each scenario or take. (usually 1 or 2 selected for every 10 shots?)
-	</strong>* = Stars of the collection, have or will prep to master files or client selects
-	<strong><strong>* = Show stoppers. These are the "Best in class" or, "cream of the crop"
-	</strong></strong>** = Reserved for future use&#8230;&#8203; (which means it could be used for temporary tagging)
Note that the star rating is done by the user/supplier and there is no universal standard for the rating between systems/collections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Natural Language Free Text Descriptions
Free-text descriptions provide valuable information about the image in human readable form.
Headline
A headline is a brief synopsis or summary of the contents of the photograph. Like a news story, the Headline should grab attention, and telegraph the content of the image to the audience. Headlines need to be succinct. Leave the supporting narrative for the Description field. Do not, however, confuse the Headline term with the Title term.
  BE AWARE: this field is limited by the IIM format to about 256 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Description/Caption
The Description field, often referred to as a ‘caption’ is used to describe the who, what (and possibly where and when) and why of what is happening in the photograph. It can include people’s names, their role in the action, the location. Geographic location details should also be entered in the Location fields. The amount of detail included will depend on the image and whether the image is documentary or conceptual. Typically, editorial images come with complete caption text, while advertising images may not.
  BE AWARE: this field is limited by the IIM format to about 2000 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Persons Depicted in the Image
For a specific person shown in the image several properties can be used:
•	Person shown in the image only – use the field Person Shown
•	If the name, an identifier and a detailed description of the person is to be entered then the field structure Person Shown with Details should be used.
Persons in the image may also be entered in the caption and keyword fields.
There are other fields associated with persons depicted in the image:
•	Additional model info
•	Model Age
•	Minor model age disclosure
•	Model Release Status
•	Model Release Identifiers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> Read also about metadata for other content on pages about general image content,  locations or other things (organisations, events, products, artwork, objects).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Person Shown in the Image
Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Person Shown in the Image, with Details
Use this field structure to record details about each relevant and recognisable person(s) shown in the image. This might include links to a global online resource which lists the person uniquely with an identifier.  There are fields to record physical characteristics and other details to help distinguish this person from others in the image.
These details are useful for identifying and distinguishing this person from others in the image.
•	Name
Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically, these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname).
•	Identifier
Use this field to enter one or more Globally Unique Identifier(s) for the person, such as those from WikiData or Freebase. This should be entered in the form of a URI.
•	Characteristics
Use this field structure including CV Term Name, CV Term ID, CV ID and Refined ‘About’ for properties or traits of the person by selecting a term from a Controlled Vocabulary (CV).</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Description
A free-text description of any actions taken, as well as any gestures or emotional expressions shown, by the person shown in the image.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional Model Information
The Additional Model Information field can be used to record information about the ethnicity and other facets of the person(s) (“model(s)”) appearing in the image. Use the Model Age field to note the age of model(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Model Age
Age of the human model(s) at the time this image was taken in a model released image. If there is more than one model in the image, the ages can be listed in any order.
The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Minor Model Age Disclosure
Age of the youngest model pictured in the image, at the time that the image was made.
The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Model Release Status
This field summarises the availability and scope of model releases authorising usage of the likenesses of persons appearing in the photograph. There are four possible values:
•	None (no release is available),
•	Not Applicable (there are no recognisable people in the image),
•	Unlimited Model Releases (releases are available for all people in the image, AND the terms of each release authorise unlimited usage of the model(s) likenesses)
•	Limited or Incomplete Model Releases (there are releases for some of the people in the image, OR one or more of the releases include terms limiting usage of model(s) likenesses).
We recommend that the PLUS controlled value Unlimited Model Releases (MR-UMR) be used sparingly, and encourage you to check the wording of the model release thoroughly before choosing this value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Model Release Identifier(s)
Use this field for the ID of each available Model Release document. Be sure to give a unique number or name to all releases (both model and property), and record that information in this field. If you don’t already include an ID name/number on your releases, consider adding one as this will make it easier to cross reference.
Locations
The original ‘Location’ fields in IPTC (Core) do not distinguish between the location where the image was created and the location shown in the image. The IPTC Location Created and Location Shown field structures were added later to remove this ambiguity.
When populating the Location fields, it is good practice to start with the sublocation which is at the lowest level of the location hierarchy. The wider Location terms define the position of the sublocation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> Read also about metadata for specific content on pages about general image content, persons or other things (organisations, events, products, artwork, objects).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All location field structures use the following geographic hierarchy:
Sublocation
This could be the name of a specific area within a city (Manhattan) or the name of a well-known location (Pyramids of Giza) or a monument or natural feature outside a city (Grand Canyon, Mont Blanc Peak)
The area covered by Sublocation may differ for the two types of location. For Location Created, the sublocation might be derived from the Exif GPS coordinates of the camera. In general, the Location Shown should specify the area of interest shown in the image, which is a broader area e.g. The Vosges Mountains.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Location (Original/Legacy)
The legacy Location fields – in most cases shown as sequence of stand-alone fields - are widely understood to express the location shown in the image. They can be used where it is important to display the location values in software which does not read Location Created and Location Shown field structures. Some software applications copy data from the Location fields to the field structure ‘Location Shown.’</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Location Created
… is the location where the image was created.
Use this field structure to specifically record the location where the photo was taken. If the location shown in the image is different from the location where the photo was taken then the IPTC field structure ‘Location Shown in the Image’ should be used to note the difference. For example, if you are photographing a mountain with a telephoto lens from a distance, you may be standing on the other side of a state or even country border.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Location Shown in Image
This field structure describes the location shown in the image. Where the subject of the image is in a different location to the camera the values should differ from those in ‘Location Created’.
Other Things Shown in the Image</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IPTC supports metadata about typically annotated things in an image:
•	Organisations
•	Events covered by the image
•	Products
•	Artwork or objects in an image</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p> Read about metadata for specific content on pages about general image content, persons or  locations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organisations (including companies) featured by the image
Featured organisations can be described by name and code:
•	Featured Organisation Name
The name of the organisation or company featured in or associated with the image. For example, an image of people at an event may list the organising or sponsoring company as a featured organisation.
•	Featured Organisation Code
A code from a known controlled vocabulary for identifying the organisation or company featured in the image. E.g. The stock ticker symbol would list Microsoft as MSFT or Adobe as ADBE. The code is not linked in this field specifically to the Organisation Name in the data structure, but it serves as an additional search term if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event
The Event field describes a specific named event associated with the image, e.g. Archimedes press conference, The Great Steamboat Race, Maui Classical Music Festival. Sub events of larger events can be included as in: XXXI Olympic Summer Games (Rio): opening ceremony.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product
The Product Shown field structure is used to describe one to many products depicted by the image. The name of the product and a textual description can be applied to the corresponding fields. To identify the product a 14 digit GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) of the product should be applied to the GTIN field, GTIN-8 to GTIN-14 codes can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

Recommended Minimal Set of Metadata Properties
IPTC is often asked which fields should be filled out as a minimum.
IPTC has selected the following set of properties as a guide to the minimum requirement:
•	Description/Caption
•	Creator/Image Creator*
•	Copyright Owner* + Copyright Notice
•	Credit line
•	Date Created - in many cases present at least as Exif value
*) For these properties also use an identifier if available.
By defining this set of minimal metadata properties IPTC does not support any removal of existing metadata outside this set without the explicit permission of the copyright owner of the image. (In simple words: this is not a permission to strip off metadata and is not legal advice.)
Fundamental Guidelines for the Preservation of Embedded Metadata
The IPTC endorses and strongly recommends adherence to the five guiding principles of the "Embedded Metadata Manifesto"
1) Metadata is essential to describe, identify and track digital media and should be applied to all media items which are exchanged as files or by other means such as data streams.
•	All people handling digital media need to recognise the crucial role of metadata for business. This involves more than just sticking labels on a media item. The knowledge required to describe the content comprehensively and concisely and the clear assertion of intellectual ownership increase the value of the asset. Adding metadata to media items is an imperative for each and every professional workflow.
2) Media file formats should provide the means to embed metadata in ways that can be read and handled by different software systems.
•	Exchanging media items is still done to a large extent by transmitting files containing the media content and in many cases this is the only (technical) way of communicating between the supplier and the consumer. To support the exchange of metadata with content it is a business requirement that file formats embed metadata within the digital file. Other methods like sidecar files are potentially exposed to metadata loss.
3) Metadata fields, their semantics (including labels on the user interface) and values, should not be changed across metadata formats.
•	The type of content information carried in a metadata field, and the values assigned, should not depend on the technology used to embed metadata into a file. If multiple technologies are available for embedding the same field the software vendors must guarantee that the values are synchronised across the technologies without causing a loss of data or ambiguity.
4) Copyright management information metadata must never be removed from the files.
•	Information identifying the image, the creator, the owner and associated rights is the only way to save digital content from being considered orphaned work. Removal of such metadata impacts on the ability to assert ownership rights and is therefore forbidden by law in many countries.
5) Other metadata should only be removed from files by agreement with their copyright holders.
•	Properly selected and applied metadata fields add value to media assets. For most collections of digital media content descriptive metadata is essential for retrieval and for understanding. Removing this valuable information devalues the asset.</p>

<p>Dates and times and different software
The way dates are displayed is dependent on software and on computer operating system settings.
The XMP specification allows the following date entries, though not all software products reflect and support this.
    - year only (if the month and day are unclear)

    - full date with time, including time zone.
Time and time zone information are not obligatory, but if a time value is added, time zone should also be recorded. If no time zone is added, the software should supply a default value.</p>

Exif currently does not hold time zone information in its time stamp. A time zone must be entered when importing Exif time information into an XMP field. Most software will apply the local time zone of the receiving computer system, so this should be checked if the image was created in a different time zone.
Metadata values shown multiple times
Some values may appear multiple times within software panels or tabs. This data is stored in only one location in the image file, but appears in the tabs for different schemas which use it as a ‘shared property’.
For example, in Adobe products data entered in the IPTC Creator field also appears in the Author field in the Description Panel. If a change is made to the data in any tab or panel, that change is replicated in the other locations.

<p>IPTC Photo Metadata and Google Images
Google has introduced a new feature of their “image search” mode in 2018. When an image is shown, one can click on “Image Credits” and a popup will show the image’s creator, credit line and a copyright notice. It works by reading the corresponding embedded IPTC photo metadata fields from the image file. The name of the creator, the copyright notices and the credit line is shown.
IPTC is taking the opportunity to show the best way that each metadata field can be filled in based on the definitions in the standard.
What fields to use, and what to put in them
Google displays three IPTC photo metadata fields, wherever available, for an image shown as search result. This tells the viewer who is the creator and who is the copyright holder of the image and what credit line should be shown next to the image. This information is taken from the IPTC photo metadata embedded in the image file.
Creator
For displaying the creator of the image, the Creator field is read and shown with the label Creator. Google first reads the ISO XMP dc:creator field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2:80 Creator field. Your editing tool probably just gives you a single field labelled “creator” so just use that and you won’t have to worry.
By its definition this field contains “the name of the photographer, but in cases where the photographer should not be identified the name of a company or organisation may be appropriate.”
Copyright Notice
Google displays the Copyright Notice field (XMP dc:rights or IIM 2:116 Copyright Notice). So while you’re tidying up your image metadata it makes sense to get this right too. The definition for this field is: “Contains any necessary copyright notice for claiming the intellectual property for artwork or an object in the image and should identify the current owner of the copyright of this work with associated intellectual property rights.” The format can differ according to the relevant copyright legislation of different countries. Again, Google first reads the ISO XMP dc:rights field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2.116 Copyright notice field.
Credit Line
The Credit Line field (XMP photoshop:Credit or IIM 2:110 Credit) is used as “the credit to person(s) and/or organisation(s) required by the supplier of the image to be used when published.” Generally this would be a line of text that the supplier expects users of the image (such as Google Images) to display to users alongside the image. Again, Google first reads the ISO XMP photoshop:credit field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2.110 Credit field.
Most tools label this field as “Credit Line” in the editing interface, but some tools call it simply “Credit”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For photo creators and editors: how to edit the metadata fields
It’s important to understand that IPTC Photo Metadata is actually embedded in the image binary file. You can’t add HTML tags or schema.org markup to add this metadata. But never fear – there are some tools you can use to edit the fields. We maintain a list of tools for editing IPTC Photo Metadata. Here are a few of the major tools we cover there:
•	Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom
•	Photographer tools such as FotoStation, PhotoMechanic, ACDSee Pro and the Digital Asset Management system Extensis Portfolio
•	For the more technical, the command-line ExifTool can be run in a script to update many images at the same time.
Each of these tools will allow you to edit fields a slightly different way. Usually there is some kind of “properties panel” or “metadata window” that lets you view and edit all embedded metadata fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For developers and site administrators: how to ensure the fields are preserved in images on your site
Your site’s digital asset management system, content management system, image management system or content delivery network may be stripping out embedded metadata fields. Some systems do this with the best of intentions, thinking that it will save a few bytes of bandwidth, but stripping out metadata actually infringes on the copyright holders’ rights and may even be illegal in some countries.
You should use a DAM and CMS that respects and conserves IPTC and XMP embedded metadata, and ensure that any configuration options that strip out metadata are turned off. Also you may need to look at image cropping and manipulation plugins for your CMS – for example the ImageMagick WordPress library retains embedded metadata, but some others strip it out.</p>

<p>Guideline for mapping Category Codes to Subject NewsCodes
Early versions of IIM included the Datasets 2:15 “Category” and 2:20 “Supplemental Category”. But these two fields were replaced in IIM version 4 (released in 1999) by the Dataset 2:12 “Subject Reference” which must be populated by values from the IPTC Subject NewsCodes controlled vocabulary. In version 4 of the IIM specification document the Datasets Category and Supplemental Category were indicated as “deprecated” which meant that after the time of this release these two Datasets should not be populated with values any longer.
To support the move from the three letter codes used with the Category Dataset to the Subject NewsCodes this table provides a reference for mapping.

<p>IPTC recommendation for metadata about composite images
Definition: a composite image is an image that is made from multiple images.
IPTC is asked how metadata about the different images the final image is made of could be expressed in a way which strictly links a metadata value to one of the source images.
IPTC recommends this procedure
1.	Create a thumbnail of the final image and draw lines along the edges between the different photos it was made of. Then apply a number to each region representing a photo.
2.	Assign numbers to the images making the composite photo: start at the left upper corner of the composite picture, go from left to right and from top to bottom. As soon as you encounter pixels from “another” image assign the next number from a sequence starting with 1. If the same source image is used for multiple regions of the composite image then apply the same number to all of them.
3.	Make this thumbnail available on the web. Add the URL of this thumbnail to the Instructions field: the added string should be “composite reference <a href="http://&#8230;&#8203;.”" class="bare">http://&#8230;&#8203;.”</a>.
The rule for finding this link is: parse the Instructions field, any URL right after the words “composite reference” is the link to this thumbnail.
4.	Prefix metadata about such a part-image with the assigned number of the reference thumbnail in square brackets. E.g. [1] …. [2] …. Metadata about the whole composite image should be prefixed with [0]
Example for the Creator field: [0] Giorgio Tintoretto [1] John Hopper [2] Pierre Monet [3] Franz Haas
IIM Metadata deprecated in IPTC Core
Some of the IIM metadata properties adopted by Adobe for the Photoshop File Info have not been carried forward into the IPTC Core schema. Data in these deprecated fields remains in the IIM header of the image, but will not be shown in IPTC Core compliant software.
The following fields from the IIM schema are deprecated in the IPTC Core schema, but are synchronised with XMP properties, and available for future use, but outside the IPTC Core.
Urgency: is used for distribution management and is synchronised with the XMP property ‘photoshop:Urgency’
Category and Supplemental Category: were deprecated and merged to form the later Subject Newscodes. See the this guideline for mapping Category Codes to the newer Subject Newscodes.
These two properties are synchronised with XMP properties ‘photoshop:Category’ and ‘photoshop:SupplementalCategories’.</p>

<p>These examples provide entries for most of the IPTC Core and Extension fields for three uses cases, see the list below.
These are examples of use of metadata and are not prescriptive. In-house rules for use of metadata differ, but we would like to encourage metadata use in line with IPTC semantics.
