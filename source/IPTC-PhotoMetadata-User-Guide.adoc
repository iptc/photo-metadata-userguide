== About this draft

This is the draft of the next version of the IPTC Photo Metadata User Guide.

Find what changes are planned and done in the https://www.iptc.org/std-dev/photometadata/documentation/userguide/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-User-Guide_ToDoRef.html[ToDo Reference document].

== Introduction

This document is designed to familiarise photographers, photo editors and metadata managers with the use of the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard. It provides a short guideline on the use and semantics of each IPTC field (also called metadata property).

The User Guide groups fields according to their category of use:

* <<General Image Content,General image content>>
* <<Persons Depicted in the Image,Person(s) shown in the image>>
* <<Locations,Locations relevant to the image>>
* <<Other Things Shown in the Image,Other things shown in the image, including artwork>>
* <<Rights Information,How to assert rights>> and <<Licensing Use of the Image,license usage>>
* <<Administration and Commissioning Details,Administration and Commissioning details>>

The <<field-reference-table,Field Reference Table>> lists all IPTC fields with their field labels for easy reference.

The <<what-is-a,What Is A...>> section explains terms used by the IPTC Standards.

There is a <<Help on Specific Topics,help section on specific topics>> such as mapping Category Codes to Subject Codes.

Sample images are shown with <<Metadata Usage Examples,full examples of metadata>> to aid in practical metadata entry. 

More <<About the IPTC Photo Metadata User Guide,about this User Guide>>, including how to contact IPTC and a Copyright Notice, is also available.

=== What IPTC Photo Metadata is Made For

Photo metadata is key to protecting images' copyright and licensing information online. It is also essential for managing digital assets. Detailed and accurate descriptions about images ensure they can be easily and efficiently retrieved via search, by users or machine-readable code. This results in smoother workflow within organizations, more precise tracking of images, and increased licensing opportunities.

Therefore, photo metadata is critical to photo and related business. IPTC has specified metadata to meet these needs; it is the industry standard of professional photography.

=== How IPTC Photo Metadata Evolved Over Time

The IPTC - https://www.iptc.org/[www.iptc.org] - is a body of content providers and system vendors from the news industry and has defined standards for metadata about news since 1979. Since the mid 1990's IPTC metadata are have been quite popular for photos as they were adopted by Adobe Photoshop at this time. The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard defining the Core and Extension metadata schemas is the second generation of IPTC photo metadata. 

IPTC's older standard for metadata, the Information Interchange Model (IIM), was issued in 1991 and defined a set of metadata properties and a data format to embed the metadata values into image files. In the early nineties a subset of this IIM was adopted as the well-known “IPTC Fields” by Adobe Photoshop and can be embedded into JPEG, TIFF and PSD files since then.

In the early 2000s, a new technology for embedding metadata into image files was invented. It is called XMP, was developed by Adobe and is now an ISO standard. This technology required defining new technical specifications for the well-known “IPTC Fields” of the IIM standard and this was done by the IPTC Core schema which was initially released in 2005 and has evolved to version 1.4 since then. A key feature in the transition to IPTC Core in XMP was that the definition of the purpose and the specified use of an IIM field should remain the same, with only the underlying technical details changed. As the IPTC Core is in fact a mirror of the IIM fields it will no longer be extended.

Discussion of IPTC Core raised the need for additional metadata properties not covered by the IIM standard. IPTC created the IPTC Extension schema in 2008. In almost all cases new fields were added to the IPTC Extension, the only exception are the Accessibility fields which were added to the Core as they complement the Core field Description.

After development over two decades IPTC Photo Metadata can be embedded in the following ways:

* IPTC Core fields can be embedded in the IIM format and/or in the XMP format. A key challenge for metadata embedded in parallel in IIM and XMP is that the values are synchronised - this should be taken care of by the image management software. 
* IPTC Extension fields can be embedded only in XMP format.

To help users, the IPTC collects information from software vendors on their support for IPTC Photo Metadata. Find out more at https://www.iptc.org/photometadata. 

Be aware that IPTC Core and IPTC Extension fields can be saved as XMP “sidecar files” for camera Raw files as some of these file formats do not support embedded metadata.

=== Photo Metadata - Under the Hood

This section explains the technical background of embedding photo metadata in an image file. (Click Details below to see it.)

[%collapsible]
====

Photo metadata has to be processed by software under the hood of panels on your computer screen. See below how this is done.
 
image:PhotoMetadata_UnderTheHood.jpg[Photo Metadata Under the Hood,width=934,height=502]

The diagram shows the flow of metadata values from an input panel on your computer screen into an image file and the way back from an image file to their display on the panel.

**What you see on your computer screen**

On the left, the diagram shows a metadata input panel for IPTC fields in your software, only a few fields are shown here.

**Inside imaging software on your computer**

In the centre, the diagram shows how your software handles the metadata. The software creates a temporary internal structure to support the data in both IIM (in blue) and XMP (in red) formats.

You can see from the orange arrows that some field values are transferred to both the IIM and the XMP structures (Creator and Description) and others only to the XMP structure (Persons Shown and Digital Source Type). Fields added to the IPTC Photo Metadata specification's Extension Schema (after 2005) exist only in XMP.

As some fields are replicated in IIM and XMP, the software has to keep these values in synch (dotted lines). This is less an issue for data transferred from the input panel than for data read from an image file.

**Inside your JPEG image file**

On the right you see the structure of an image file with sections for metadata (headers) and a section for image data (the pixels). The diagram shows that the IIM and XMP data structures are stored in two different headers. In a JPEG file the headers are of type APP1 and APP13 and they may have additional internal identifiers for the metadata formats.

The data structures are embedded into the headers using different technical formats:

* IIM is a sequence of bytes, where each field has a numeric identifier (2:80 and 2:120)
* XMP is a single (long) text string using XML as markup language, typically using angle brackets <> as delimiters. Fields are identified by strings like dc:creator.

The green arrows show how data from the internal software structure is embedded in the headers of the image file. If this file is copied to another computer, then exactly this set of embedded bytes takes the metadata to the new location.

**Metadata from the image file to your screen panel**

Data embedded in the image file can be read by software, so the process also works from right to left on the diagram, as shown by the bi-directional arrows. The software reads from the metadata headers and stores the information in its internal structures. The software has to verify that the IIM and XMP values are the same; if they are not, there are rules about which value should take precedence. At the end of this process IIM and XMP values are the same.

The values are then displayed on the panel on your computer screen and are ready for editing. Pressing Save, sends the data back to the image file for embedding as before.

== How to Edit Metadata for ...

This section groups metadata fields according to information type.

=== General Image Content

A key use of metadata is to describe the content of an image. This can be done in two basic ways:

* Using standard terms from value lists or controlled vocabularies.
+
Choosing terms from a standard list of values enables easier and more consistent search within a single collection or across collections. Controlled vocabularies are one form of value list. 
* Using free-text (natural language)

TIP: Read also about metadata for specific content on pages about
<<Persons depicted in the Image,persons>>,
<<Locations,locations>> or
<<Other things shown in the Image,other things>> (organisations, events, products,
artwork, objects).

==== Keyword

Enter keywords to describe the visible and abstract content of the photograph.  Keywords are in free text form, and may be single or compound terms.

Keywords are descriptive words added to an image to enable search and retrieval. They describe what is visible in the image and concepts associated with the image. Keywords are expressed as a list of terms. Keywords can be single or compound terms.

Values from the controlled vocabulary IPTC Subject Codes should be placed into the “Subject Code” field.

WARNING: Keywords may have to be separated by commas or other separators depending on the software. The field for each keyword is limited by the IIM format to about 64 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== IPTC Subject Code (Legacy)

This field can be used to specify and categorise the content of a photograph by using one or more subjects as listed in the IPTC “Subject NewsCodes” taxonomy (available from http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/subjectcode). Each subject term is represented as a code of 8 digits in an unordered list. Only subjects from this controlled vocabulary should be used in this field, free text keywords should be entered into the Keyword field. +
As this vocabulary is not maintained by IPTC since 2010 the use of this field is a legacy. For the classification of images use the IPTC Media Topics vocabulary now, see: http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/mediatopic. For the Media Topics the CV Term About Image field must be used - see it just below.

==== CV-Term About the Image

This field structure is a generic way to add one or more terms, themes or named entities to describe the image.

Multiple terms may be used; each term must be taken from an identified Controlled Vocabulary. Terms may be from different Controlled Vocabularies.

This CV field enables users to enter terms about the image from specific controlled vocabularies. Terms from one or more vocabularies may be entered.

The structure is:

CV Term Name::
taken from a Controlled Vocabulary
CV Term ID::
Unique identifier for the term in the Controlled Vocabulary.
CV ID::
Unique identifier for the Controlled Vocabulary (often a URL).
Refined "About"::
Optional: globally Unique identifier for a concept refining the ‘about' relationship between the image and the CV term. Example: the concept could stand for emotions shown by persons in the image. 

==== Intellectual Genre

Globally unique identifier for controlled terms to describe the genre of the photo. The IPTC Genre vocabulary may be used http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/genre or other genre vocabularies more focused on photography.

==== Genre (generic)

This field structure is a generic way to describe the genre of the photo with a value from any Controlled Vocabulary. (The Intellectual Genre actively supports only the use of an IPTC vocabulary.)

Multiple genre terms may be used; each term must be taken from an identified Controlled Vocabulary.

Genre Terms from one or more vocabularies may be entered.

The structure is:

CV Term Name::
taken from a Controlled Vocabulary
CV Term ID::
Unique identifier for the term in the Controlled Vocabulary.
CV ID::
Unique identifier for the Controlled Vocabulary (often a URL).
Refined "About"::
Optional: globally Unique identifier for a concept refining the kind of genre CV this term originates from. Example: the used genre CV is providing terms of journalistic genres, product genres, usage genres, etc. 

==== IPTC Scene Code

This field is used to describe the scene of a photo using one or more terms from the IPTC "Scene-NewsCodes". You should only enter values from the IPTC Scene controlled vocabulary (available from http://www.newscodes.org and http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/scene). Each IPTC Scene term is represented as a 6 digit numerical string in an unordered list.

==== Image Rating

Many professional photo applications have had a image rating feature for some time. These are typically shown as star ratings within a collection and are used to indicate the quality of an image; typically giving one star for entry-level photos, and reserving the higher numbered values for more special or unique images. Assigning a star rating as part of a workflow will make it easier to quickly find, sort, or filter out more valuable images from a grouping at a later point in time. 

Photographers may use a method where any ‘keepers' from an assignment are given one star during an initial review. On a second pass they may give a two-star rating to those images deemed superior, or even three stars for those that are outstanding. These values may differ from what an agency or distributor uses, so they may be overwritten or re-evaluated. Some editors recommend that you think of this as a pyramid, with a 10 to 1 ratio between each level. This method will ensure you won't end up with too many ‘special' photos in a collection.

To make sure you consistently apply the same image rating criteria each time, write down your rationale. Then put this text somewhere you can refer to each time you are editing. 

Here is one photographer's image rating rationale as an example:

* 0 stars = record shots, or don't delete immediately (fall back images)
* pass:[*] = Entry level threshold achieved (in focus, exposure within reason)
* pass:[**] = Best shot from each scenario or take. (usually 1 or 2 selected for every 10 shots?)
* pass:[***] = Stars of the collection, have or will prep to master files or client selects
* pass:[****] = Show stoppers. These are the "Best in class" or, "cream of the crop"
* pass:[*****] = Reserved for future use... (which means it could be used for temporary tagging)

Note that the star rating is done by the user/supplier and there is no universal standard for the rating between systems/collections.

=== Natural Language Free Text Descriptions

Free-text descriptions provide valuable information about the image in human readable form.

==== Headline

A headline is a brief synopsis or summary of the contents of the photograph. Like a news story, the Headline should grab attention, and telegraph the content of the image to the audience. Headlines need to be succinct. Leave the supporting narrative for the Description field. Do not, however, confuse the Headline term with the Title term.

WARNING: This field is limited by the IIM format to about 256 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Description/Caption

The Description field, often referred to as a ‘caption' is used to describe the who, what (and possibly where and when) and why of what is happening in the photograph. It can include people’s names, their role in the action, the location. Geographic location details should also be entered in the Location fields. The amount of detail included will depend on the image and whether the image is documentary or conceptual. Typically, editorial images come with complete caption text, while advertising images may not.

The Description field should not be confused with the field for Alt Text (Accessibility), see below. The Description is often presented as a visible caption below the image and provides the facts about an image. Alt Text may be hidden from view within the HTML coding of a website; this field is intended to be read out loud by text-to-speech and assistive technologies. 


WARNING: This field is limited by the IIM format to about 2000 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Alt Text (Accessibility)

This field is used to provide a brief textual description of the purpose and meaning of an image that can be accessed by assistive technology or displayed when the image is disabled in the browser. The purpose of Alt Text is to provide a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose. 

While there is effectively no character limitation for Alt Text, the best practice is to keep the description short (a couple of sentences) so that assistive technology users can quickly navigate images on a page. If more detail is required to provide a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, use Alt Text (Accessibility) to provide a summary and Extended Description (Accessibility) (see below) to provide additional details about the image. 

This field should not be confused with the IPTC field Headline, which is a brief synopsis or summary of the contents of the image. +
The Alt Text is required for conformance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Success Criterion 1.1.1 Text Alternatives.  In the past some may have used the values in the Headline or Description fields to populate the alt text for websites and digital products. IPTC created this dedicated Alt Text (Accessibility) field which should be used instead.

Top 5 Tips for Writing Alt Text:

. **Be specific:** Effectively convey the visual message by describing all meaningful and relevant details.
. **Keep it short:** Be as brief as you can. Know when you need to write more for complex images.
. **Limit keywords:** Alt Text is definitely not for boosting SEO. Beware of SEO-focused alt text “shortcuts.”
. **Don’t repeat information:** Don’t copy/paste or auto-populate from adjacent text on the page.
. **Incorporate context:** Alt Text must make sense and flow with the surrounding page content.

WARNING: In XMP there is effectively no character limit. However, some editing interfaces may indicate when a specific number - of about 250 - of charactersis exceeded. 


==== Extended Description (Accessibility)

The Extended Description (Accessibility) field can be used to provide a more detailed textual description of the purpose and meaning of an image that elaborates on the information provided by the Alt Text (Accessibility) field. Extended Description (Accessibility)  is not required if the Alt Text (Accessibility) field provides a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose. 

This property should not be confused with the IPTC property Description/Caption. Extended Description (Accessibility) can be combined with Alt Text (Accessibility) if and when a brief description does not provide a text equivalent to the image. It should not repeat the information in the Alt Text (Accessibility) property. This property is required for conformance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Success Criterion 1.1.1 Text Alternatives.  In the past some may have used Description/Caption to populate Alt Text or Long Description (Extended Description is a more recent term) for websites and digital products. IPTC created this dedicated Extended Description (Accessibility) field and this should be used instead. 

WARNING: Be aware that this IPTC field does not support formatted text or HTML markup.  


=== Persons Depicted in the Image

For a specific person shown in the image several properties can be used:

* Person shown in the image only - use the field *Person Shown*
* If the name, an identifier and a detailed description of the person is to be entered then the field structure *Person Shown with Details* should be used.

Persons in the image may also be entered in the caption and keyword fields.

There are other fields associated with persons depicted in the image:

* <<Additional Model Information,Additional Model Information>>
* <<Model Age,Model Age>>
* <<Minor Model Age Disclosure,Minor Model Age Disclosure>>
* <<Model Release Status,Model Release Status>>
* <<#_model_release_identifiers,Model Release Identifiers>>

TIP: Read also about metadata for specific content on pages about
<<General Image Content,general image content>>,
<<Locations,locations>> or
<<Other things shown in the Image,other things>> (organisations, events, products,
artwork, objects).
 
==== Person Shown in the Image

Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname).

==== Person Shown in the Image, with Details

Use this field structure to record details about each relevant and recognisable person(s) shown in the image. This might include links to a global online resource which lists the person uniquely with an identifier.  There are fields to record physical characteristics and other details to help distinguish this person from others in the image.

These details are useful for identifying and distinguishing this person from others in the image.

* **Name** +
Use this field to note the name of a person or persons shown in the image. Typically, these would be recorded as they would be typed in a query, first name / last name (given name / surname).
* **Identifier** +
Use this field to enter one or more Globally Unique Identifier(s) for the person, such as those from WikiData or Freebase. This should be entered in the form of a URI.
* **Characteristics** +
Use this field structure including CV Term Name, CV Term ID, CV ID and Refined ‘About' for properties or traits of the person by selecting a term from a Controlled Vocabulary (CV). 
* **Description** +
A free-text description of any actions taken, as well as any gestures or emotional expressions shown, by the person shown in the image.

==== Additional Model Information 

The Additional Model Information field can be used to record information about the ethnicity and other facets of the person(s) (“model(s)”) appearing in the image. Use the Model Age field to note the age of model(s).

==== Model Age

Age of the human model(s) at the time this image was taken in a model released image. If there is more than one model in the image, the ages can be listed in any order.

The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models.

==== Minor Model Age Disclosure

Age of the youngest model pictured in the image, at the time that the image was made. 
The user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models.

==== Model Release Status

This field summarises the availability and scope of model releases authorising usage of the likenesses of persons appearing in the photograph.

There are four possible values: 

* None (no release is available), 
* Not Applicable (there are no recognisable people in the image), 
* Unlimited Model Releases (releases are available for all people in the image, AND the terms of each release authorise unlimited usage of the model(s) likenesses)
* Limited or Incomplete Model Releases (there are releases for some of the people in the image, OR one or more of the releases include terms limiting usage of model(s) likenesses). 

We recommend that the PLUS controlled value Unlimited Model Releases (MR-UMR) be used sparingly, and encourage you to check the wording of the model release thoroughly before choosing this value.

==== Model Release Identifier(s)

Use this field for the ID of each available Model Release document. Be sure to give a unique number or name to all releases (both model and property), and record that information in this field. If you don't already include an ID name/number on your releases, consider adding one as this will make it easier to cross reference.

=== Locations

The original ‘Location' fields in IPTC (Core) do not distinguish between the location where the image was created and the location shown in the image. The IPTC Location Created and Location Shown field structures were added later to remove this ambiguity. 

When populating the Location fields, it is good practice to start with the sublocation which is at the lowest level of the location hierarchy. The wider Location terms define the position of the sublocation.

TIP: Read also about metadata for specific content on pages about
<<General Image Content,general image content>>,
<<Persons depicted in the Image,persons>> or
<<Other things shown in the Image,other things>> (organisations, events, products,
artwork, objects).

All location field structures use the following geographic hierarchy:
Sublocation::
This could be the name of a specific area within a city (Manhattan) or the name of a well-known location (Pyramids of Giza) or a monument or natural feature outside a city (Grand Canyon, Mont Blanc Peak) 
The area covered by Sublocation may differ for the two types of location. For Location Created, the sublocation might be derived from the Exif GPS coordinates of the camera. In general, the Location Shown should specify the area of interest shown in the image, which is a broader area e.g. The Vosges Mountains.

City::
The name of the city or town or nearest human settlement such as village.  If there is no data for ‘city', leave the field blank and enter details in sublocation and other fields in the hierarchy.

State/Province ::
The name of the State or Province or other sub-region of a country. Use of the full name, rather than the abbreviation, is advisable for international audiences.

Country::
The name of the country.

Country Code::
Country codes are two or three letter upper-case codes as defined by the ISO 3166 standard. 
The codes are available from: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/. If both the Country and Country Code fields are used, the Country Code is the authoritative reference. Most photo businesses use the 3 letter code.

World Region::
The name of the region of the world.

WARNING: The location fields are limited by the IIM format to about 32 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Location (Original/Legacy)

The legacy Location fields - in most cases shown as sequence of stand-alone fields - are widely understood to express the location shown in the image. They can be used where it is important to display the location values in software which does not read Location Created and Location Shown field structures. Some software applications copy data from the Location fields to the field structure ‘Location Shown.' 

==== Location Created

The location where the image was created.

Use this field structure to specifically record the location where the photo was taken. If the location shown in the image is different from the location where the photo was taken then the IPTC field structure ‘Location Shown in the Image' should be used to note the difference. For example, if you are photographing a mountain with a telephoto lens from a distance, you may be standing on the other side of a state or even country border.

==== Location Shown in Image 

This field structure describes the location shown in the image. Where the subject of the image is in a different location to the camera the values should differ from those in ‘Location Created'. 

=== Other Things Shown in the Image

IPTC supports metadata about typically annotated things in an image:
* Organisations
* Events covered by the image
* Products
* Artwork or objects in an image

TIP: Read also about metadata for specific content on pages about
<<General Image Content,general image content>>,
<<Persons depicted in the Image,persons>>,
<<Locations,locations>> or
<<Other things shown in the Image,other things>> (organisations, events, products,
artwork, objects).

==== Organisations (including companies) featured by the image

Featured organisations can be described by name and code:

Featured Organisation Name::
The name of the organisation or company featured in or associated with the image. For example, an image of people at an event may list the organising or sponsoring company as a featured organisation.
Featured Organisation Code::
A code from a known controlled vocabulary for identifying the organisation or company featured in the image. E.g. The stock ticker symbol would list Microsoft as MSFT or Adobe as ADBE. The code is not linked in this field specifically to the Organisation Name in the data structure, but it serves as an additional search term if necessary.

==== Event

The Event field describes a specific named event associated with the image, e.g. Archimedes press conference, The Great Steamboat Race, Maui Classical Music Festival. Sub events of larger events can be included as in: XXXI Olympic Summer Games (Rio): opening ceremony. +
In 2023 the field **Event Indentifier** was introduced to add a unique identifier to the event. Example: the URL of a page about the event can be used as identifier.

==== Product

The Product Shown field structure is used to describe one to many products depicted by the image. The **name** of the product and a textual **description** can be applied to the corresponding fields. To identify the product a single 14 digit **GTIN** (Global Trade Item Number) of the product should be applied to the GTIN field, GTIN-8 to GTIN-14 codes can be used too. For identifiers beyond GTIN the field **Identifier** can be used, multiple may be applied.

==== Artwork or Object in the Image

This field structure is used to record information about artworks or other objects in the image, and includes descriptive, administrative and rights information. This category covers paintings, sculptures, objects, and other items of interest for cultural heritage such as archaeological finds.

The date (and optionally the time) that artworks or objects in the image were created. Please note that historical dates (before about 1900) may be handled differently by different operating systems and/or software versions and the same holds for partial dates such as year only. It may be advisable to also enter dates before that year in the Circa Date Created field. Do not confuse this field value with the Date Created field for the image showing this artwork or object.
Circa Date Created (AO) ::
A free text field for use where the exact date of creation of the artwork or object is unknown. An approximate date is entered in text rather than date format e.g. ‘ca 1900', ‘19th century'
Style Period (AO)::
Free-text field for style, historical or artistic period, movement, group, or school describing  the artwork or object.
Creator (AO)::
Name of the creator of the artwork or other objects in the image. Where the artist cannot or should not be identified, the name of a company or organisation may be used. Do not confuse this field value with the Creator of the image showing this artwork or object.
Creator ID (AO)::
Globally unique identifier for the creator of the artwork or object in the image. For example use an identifier issued by an online registry of persons or companies. 
Multiple IDs should be entered in the same sequence as the creator names.

A globally unique identifier for the current copyright owner e.g. issued by an online registry of persons or companies.
Do not confuse this field value with the Identifier field of the Copyright Owner of the image showing this artwork or object.
Current Licensor Name (AO) ::
Name of the current licensor of the artwork or object.
Do not confuse this field value with the Name field of the Licensor of the image showing this artwork or object.
Current Licensor ID (AO) ::
A globally unique identifier for the current licensor e.g. issued by an online registry of persons or companies.
Do not confuse this field value with the Identifier field of the Licensor of the image showing this artwork or object.

=== Rights Information

This section is about how to record rights information for an image. 

TIP: Read also the section about <<Licensing Use of the Image,licensing the use of the image>>.

NOTE: Be aware that values assigned to rights-related metadata fields - including fields about licensing – of an image may be affected a) by laws and other regulations of the region in which the image is used, and b) by contracts applying to the image.

The creator of the image as owner of rights can be identified by two fields:
<<#_creator_free_text,Creator>> a free text field for the name of the Creator and 
<<#_image_creator_structure,Image Creator>> a field structure including the name of the Creator and an identifier for the Creator.

IPTC recommends using the older Creator name only field for all images. The newer field structure (Name and ID) should be used in addition to this, when a Creator identifier is available.  

Creator data saved in these fields should not be altered over time.

The Image Creator, Copyright Owner, Image Supplier and Licensor may be the same or different entities.

==== Creator (free text)

Name of the creator of the image. Where the artist cannot or should not be identified, the name of a company or organisation may be use.

NOTE: Before the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard 2014 the semantics of this field were restricted to the original copyright owner of the image.)

WARNING: This field is limited by the IIM format to about 32 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Data Mining

This field can be used to communicate permissions and prohibitions on the use of your images for data mining for the purpose of AI/ML training, generative AI/ML traning and more. It uses a standardised list of values, jointly developed by IPTC and the PLUS Coalition, see it below. +
You can choose a single value for this field only; or you use a value for this field in combination with another field like the <<Other Constraints>>, or the <<Linked Encoded Rights Expressions,Linked  Encoded Rights Expression>> field or <<Embedded Encoded Rights Expressions>> field. See the notes on this use below. 

NOTE: Please note that regional laws applying to an image may prohibit, constrain, or allow data mining for certain purposes (such as search indexing or research), and may overrule the value selected for this field. Similarly, the absence of a prohibition does not indicate that the asset owner grants permission for data mining or any other use of an image.

One of these values can be applied to the Data Mining field:

* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-UNSPECIFIED[Unspecified] - no prohibition defined
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-ALLOWED[Allowed] - any kind of data mining
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED-AIMLTRAINING[Prohibited for AI/ML training]
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED-GENAIMLTRAINING[Prohibited for Generative AI/ML training]
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED-EXCEPTSEARCHENGINEINDEXING[Prohibited except for search engine indexing] - it permits only data mining by search engines available to the public to identify the URL for an image and its associated data, and prohibits all other uses
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED[Prohibited] - any kind of data mining
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED-SEECONSTRAINT[Prohibited, see Other Constraints] field - the <<Other Constraints>> field should have a value
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED-SEEEMBEDDEDRIGHTSEXPR[Prohibited, see Embedded Encoded Rights Expression] field - the <<Embedded Encoded Rights Expressions>> field should have a value
* link:http://ns.useplus.org/ldf/vocab/DMI-PROHIBITED-SEELINKEDRIGHTSEXPR[Prohibited, see Linked Encoded Rights Expression] field - the <<Linked Encoded Rights Expressions,Linked Encoded Rights Expression>> field should have a value

IMPORTANT: Each value above has a URL as link to a page specifying it. This URL MUST be used as value and not the free text name.


==== Other Constraints

This field can be used to indicate any additional constraints on the use of the image by natural free text. These constraints may be used to limit the scope of usage allowed.

==== Property Release Status

This field summarises the availability and scope of property releases for the photograph.

There are four possible values: 

* None (no release is available)
* Not Applicable (there are no items requiring a property release in the image)
* Unlimited Property Releases (releases are available for all property shown in the image)
* Limited or Incomplete Property Releases (there are releases for some property shown in the image).
We recommend that the PLUS specified value Unlimited Property Releases (PR-UPR) be used with care, and encourage you to check the wording of the property release thoroughly before choosing this value.

==== Property Release Identifier(s)

Use this field to indicate the ID for each Property Release document. Ensure all releases (both model and property) are assigned a unique number, and record that information in this field.

TIP: Read about Model Releases on the page about persons in an image.

==== Web Statement of Rights

The Web Statement of Rights can be used to link the viewer to a web page (by a URL) which provides a statement of the copyright ownership and usage rights of the image. In the Adobe ‘File Info' panel this field is called the ‘Copyright Info URL.'

=== Licensing Use of the Image

This section provides fields for information required when licensing an image. 

TIP: Read also the section about <<Rights Information,rights information>>.

NOTE: Be aware that values assigned to rights-related metadata fields - including fields about licensing – of an image may be affected a) by laws and other regulations of the region in which the image is used, and b) by contracts applying to the image.

==== Rights Usage Terms

This field is for free-text instructions on how the image may be legally used. E.g. ‘Permission is required from (Supplier or Creator) to publish this image' or ‘Licensed to (Customer) for use in (publication) until (date)'. 

For more detailed licensing terms, you may use the PLUS ‘Media Selector', or another standardised vocabulary. This field may also be used to indicate a Creative Commons Licence assigned to the image.

There may be more than one person writing descriptions for the image. In this case, make sure to specify the descriptions each writer worked on. For example, Description: Jane Doe; Alt Text and Extended Description: John Doe. 

WARNING: This field is limited by the IIM format to about 32 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Title

A short human readable reference for the image. It can be a text reference or a numeric reference, and serves primarily as an identifier. It has been used by photographers for their image filename, though since about 2008 IPTC now provides specific fields for image IDs like Digital Image GUID or Registry Entry (those wishing to, can use the Registry Entry. The Title field should not be confused with the Headline field which is a short descriptive field about the content of an image.

A short human readable reference for the image. It can be a text reference or a numeric reference, and serves primarily as an identifier. The Title field has often been used by photographers for the image filename, but IPTC now provides specific fields for image IDs including the Supplier's Image ID, The Digital Image GUID,  and the Registry Entry fields.  The Title field should not be confused with the Headline field which is a short descriptive field about the content of an image, or with the AO Title field which contains the title of the artwork or object in the the image.

WARNING: This field is limited by the IIM format to about 64 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Job Identifier
A number or textual identifier for the job for which the image was supplied. This field can allow job information to be tracked through the workflow.

NOTE: This field is named ‘Transmission Reference' in the IIM but its use has changed as reflected by this name after the adoption by Adobe Photoshop.

WARNING: This field is limited by the IIM format to about 32 characters. In XMP there is effectively no character limit.

==== Instructions

A free text field for instructions to the receiver from the creator or supplier of the image. Instructions can may include details of embargoes, restrictions, or any other rights or technical information needed for the end use. Be aware that there are more specific rights expressions fields (see Rights Information and Licensing sections) which can be used.

==== Image Registry Entry

A field structure used to describe a registry entry for the image. The record must include identifiers for the registry and the registered item as below:

Registry Organisation Identifier::
Globally unique identifier for the registry issuing the ID for the image. The identifier may be textual or numeric and is usually a URL e.g. http://www.plus-id.org 
Registry Item Identifier::
A unique identifier created and held within the registry identified above. 
Role::
An identifier of the reason and/or purpose for this Registry Entry. The identifier must be a URL (URI). Examples: major registry of this photo, alternative registry of this photo, national registry of photos, etc.

==== Max Avail Width/Height

These fields together define the maximum image size in pixel dimensions available from the original image (which may have been downsized).

==== Digital Source Type

This field indicates the media source from which the digital image was created. The values are taken from a controlled list, available at http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype. See <<digitalsourcetype,Guidance for using Digital Source Type>> in this document for more details.

==== Digital Image GUID

A globally unique identifier (GUID) for the digital image. The identifier, may be created by technical equipment such as camera or scanner as early as possible in the workflow. The creation of the identifier must comply with the technical requirements for a GUID, and should ideally identify the equipment used. Once entered, the GUID should not be changed. 

=== Image Regions

==== Introduction

You can use the IPTC Image Region to record details for designated areas within a still photo using rectangles, circles and polygons. You can give each image region a name and an identifier (if desired) and note what type of role (see link:http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/imageregionrole/[IPTC's CV]) the region plays and the type of content (see link:http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/imageregiontype/[IPTC's CV]) within that region. (The use of both IPTC CVs is recommended but not mandatory.)

There are many times when you need to identify people within an image. This can be difficult especially when all the people don’t line up in nice ‘left-to-right’ rows. The Image Region feature gives you a way to: isolate each person’s face or body in an image (using a rectangle, circle or polygon), give it an identifier and name, indicate that the marked area is a link:http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/imageregionrole/subjectArea[subject area] and indicate that the type of content is a link:http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/imageregiontype/human[human]. Finally add the IPTC field link:https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#person-shown-in-the-image[Person Shown in Image] to the Image Region with the name of the framed person.

If you create photo composites, the IPTC Image Region can be used to identify each of the different entities making up the composite and tie the provider’s name or copyright notice back to each.

Suggestions for how the image could be cropped to accommodate different layouts can now be embedded into the image itself. For example, you could mark a horizontal rectangle within a vertical image and indicate that the role for this marked area is a link:http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/imageregionrole/landscapeCropping[“landscape format cropping”] for that image. 

It should be possible to automatically map the face-tagging features in some cameras to the IPTC Image Regions so you would only have to add the name of the person to the regions. In addition, auto-tagging or image recognition systems could create image regions and auto-fill the embedded Image Region metadata fields.

This is a new feature, so it’s quite likely that there are other use cases which haven’t even been thought of yet. Talk to your software developers and ask them to implement this feature, and share with them your ideas for how you intend to use the IPTC Image Regions.

==== Image Regions - Under the Hood

Read on if you are  planning to implement Image Regions into your software, or are simply curious about what needs to happen under the hood to make the IPTC Image Regions feature work properly. 

Metadata for one to many image regions can be embedded in the image files. In time, this data should be read automatically and could be transformed into data displaying the shapes of the regions within an HTML page or in special software. These image region boundaries could be shown in a layer over or above the image and should be identified by the color of the boundary or by an identifier shown next to the boundary. Additional details about each image region should be shown in the same page/view—either outside the image (with it identified as a reference) or when hovering the mouse over an image region.

WARNING: The IPTC Image Region specification allows these various facets of the metadata to be embedded right after having set the boundaries and included details. However, during the lifecycle of an image its size and format may be changed and this requires that the software used to monitor image changes properly understands and updates these Image Region values each time changes are made. For example if you have a horizontal image with four people shown, and set Image Regions around the face of each person; then software used later to crop the image to a square needs to know which people have been removed by cropping and to adjust the coordinates of Image Regions of the persons remaining in the image as well as update/modify the metadata values and embed the values appropriately. If such adjustments are not made the boundaries of Image Regions may appear in the wrong positions and could even be invalid as coordinates may exceed the current width or height of an image.

If images are cropped or resized and if the coordinates of the boundary of an Image Region are not adjusted it is very likely that they no longer frame the intended region. Therefore, if an Image Region asserts to be about a male person and the boundary touches or encompasses a female person one can assume that the image region is no longer valid. 

As IPTC Image Regions employ and rely upon coordinates expressed by relative size values or pixel count, Image Region metadata is vulnerable to corruption (rendering the metadata inaccurate) should any of the following changes occur:

* Cropping (if the Point Zero of the coordinates is changed, all x- and y-axis values must be adjusted and any Image Region no longer part of the image must be removed)
* Resampling (if using a pixel count for coordinates when expressing width, height and radius of an Image Region these values must follow the resampling ratio. If these metadata fields are expressed using relative size values no adjustment is required)
* Resizing (if using a pixel count for coordinates when expressing width, height and radius of an Image Region these values must follow the scale of resizing. If these metadata fields are expressed using relative size values no adjustment is required)
* Rotating (if the Orientation Tag is used, no change of Image Region data is required)

CAUTION: If images are changed in artistic actions like resizing width and height differently or ‘stirring’ the pixels with an artistic filter IPTC recommends to remove the Image Regions as it may be very hard or impossible to adjust the boundary of Image Regions and the goal for the image may have changed from providing facts to providing artistic work.

In addition, if Image Region metadata has been applied to a composite image (an image made up of two or more images), then Image Region metadata is vulnerable to corruption (rendering the metadata inaccurate) should any of the following changes occur to the various elements:

* Adding additional elements in a composite image
* Removing elements in a composite image
* Shifting position/location of elements in a composite image
* Resizing portions of a composite image 
* Adding or removing borders

The IPTC invites and encourages developers to create solutions designed to allow IPTC Image Regions to survive image alterations. At the time of this feature release no such solutions are available. In the interim the IPTC recommends that users exercise caution in relying upon the IPTC Image Regions to identify or express metadata regarding people, objects or other subject matter appearing in a photograph, as this data may be inaccurate.

In particular, to mitigate legal liability, IPTC recommends that users exercise extreme caution if/when using the IPTC Image Regions to express rights-related information pertaining to any element/s of a photograph (such as copyright, property rights or model release information).  

==== Note about the Exif SubjectArea and the IPTC Image Region

From 2020 to the end of 2023 this section had a guideline for mapping data between the IPTC Image Region and the Exif SubjectArea. Unfortunately this mapping was built on the assumption Exif’s SubjectArea may be used for metadata about what this area shows, e.g. the name of a person or an object. This assumption was wrong and therefore the guideline about this mapping was removed in 2023. Please do not map between the IPTC Image Region and the Exif SubjectArea.

== What is a ... (help)

=== What is a Field / Field Structure / Property?

Data about an image - the metadata - can be expressed in a single field, or in a field structure. 

Single field::
One value is sufficient to express the desired information. Examples: Date Created, Description, Copyright Notice
Field structure::
Multiple values are used to express different facets of the information. Example: Facets such as city, province or state, country and world region are used to pinpoint a specific Location and remove any ambiguity.

A metadata property is the generic term for a field or field structure used as defined particle of metadata.

=== What is a Value List / Controlled Vocabulary?

The value of a photo metadata field can be selected and applied in two basic ways:

Free (text) value::
The person editing a field can type in anything appropriate, no formal limitations or limitations in available values apply. Typical examples are the Description, the Headline or the Copyright Notice fields.
Already defined value::
The person editing a field can only select one or more out of many already defined values. Such a set of values is called a *value list* or in the case of a specific authority managing this list a *controlled vocabulary*. Typical examples are the Country Code, the Subject Code, or the Digital Source Type fields. Actually also date fields can be considered as picking a value from a predefined list.

=== What is an ISO Country Code?

The International Standards Organisation - ISO, www.iso.org - defines among many other standards also codes representing country names as ISO 3166 standard. In the IPTC Country Code field country names can be presented by a two-letter, a three-letter, but not the numeric code defined by ISO.

A full list of currently defined country names in English and French can be obtained from https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/. Note that the codes of country names not existing anymore, e.g. Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia, are not shown on this list.

=== What is a Model or Property Release?

For many assets its owner has the right to decide if a picture of it may be published or not.

A Model Release is a document granting the right to use an image of a person depicted. The law on the rights of people shown in images varies in different countries, but use of a model release is essential in some fields of photography, and the release should detail the scope of the intended use.

A Property Release is a documents granting the right to use an image of an object depicted, mainly used for images of buildings and interiors.

For legal advice on both types of releases, you should consult a lawyer.

=== What is IIM?

IIM stands for Information Interchange Model. An IPTC metadata standard created in 1991 which defines a rich set of metadata properties and a format for embedding values into binary files. A subset of the properties was adopted by Adobe for the File Info panels of Photoshop and other software. Find more about it at www.iptc.org/IIM 

=== What is PLUS?

The Picture License Universal System (PLUS) is a rich set of metadata for expressing usage rights and licenses for images. Find more about it at http://www.useplus.org. The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard has adopted some of them, e.g. Image Creator, Copyright Owner or Licensor.

Note about identifiers of PLUS' entity properties: it is advised to use there globally unique identifiers issued by publicly accessible organisations or registries. Only if no such identifier is available a simple text string may be used.

=== What is XMP?

XMP stands for Extensible Metadata Platform. Created by Adobe Systems Inc. in 2001 as data format for metadata fields. The data can be embedded into binary files or be saved as external sidecar files. XMP as such does not define any metadata properties/fields, they are defined by special schemas which make use of XMP. Some of these schemas are maintained by Adobe, many others by other standardisation bodies like the IPTC. Find more about XMP at http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/

== Help on Specific Topics

This section provides views with more details on topics which were mentioned in the generic part of the user guide.

=== Recommended Minimal Set of Metadata Properties

IPTC is often asked which fields should be filled out as a minimum.

IPTC has selected the following set of properties as a guide to the minimum requirement:

* Description/Caption
* Creator/Image Creator*
* Copyright Owner* + Copyright Notice
* Credit line
* Date Created - in many cases present at least as Exif value

*) For these properties also use an identifier if available.

By defining this set of minimal metadata properties IPTC does not support any removal of existing metadata outside this set without the explicit permission of the copyright owner of the image. (In simple words: this is not a permission to strip off metadata and is not legal advice.)

=== Fundamental Guidelines for the Preservation of Embedded Metadata

The IPTC endorses and strongly recommends adherence to the five guiding principles of the "Embedded Metadata Manifesto":

. *Metadata is essential to describe, identify and track digital media and should be applied to all media items which are exchanged as files or by other means such as data streams.*
+
All people handling digital media need to recognise the crucial role of metadata for business. This involves more than just sticking labels on a media item. The knowledge required to describe the content comprehensively and concisely and the clear assertion of intellectual ownership increase the value of the asset. Adding metadata to media items is an imperative for each and every professional workflow.

. *Media file formats should provide the means to embed metadata in ways that can be read and handled by different software systems.*
+
Exchanging media items is still done to a large extent by transmitting files containing the media content and in many cases this is the only (technical) way of communicating between the supplier and the consumer. To support the exchange of metadata with content it is a business requirement that file formats embed metadata within the digital file. Other methods like sidecar files are potentially exposed to metadata loss.

. *Metadata fields, their semantics (including labels on the user interface) and values, should not be changed across metadata formats.*
+
The type of content information carried in a metadata field, and the values assigned, should not depend on the technology used to embed metadata into a file. If multiple technologies are available for embedding the same field the software vendors must guarantee that the values are synchronised across the technologies without causing a loss of data or ambiguity.

. *Copyright management information metadata must never be removed from the files.*
+
Information identifying the image, the creator, the owner and associated rights is the only way to save digital content from being considered orphaned work. Removal of such metadata impacts on the ability to assert ownership rights and is therefore forbidden by law in many countries.

. *Other metadata should only be removed from files by agreement with their copyright holders.*
+
Properly selected and applied metadata fields add value to media assets. For most collections of digital media content descriptive metadata is essential for retrieval and for understanding. Removing this valuable information devalues the asset.

=== Dates and times and different software

The way dates are displayed is dependent on software and on computer operating system settings.

The XMP specification allows the following date entries, though not all software products reflect and support this. 

    - year only (if the month and day are unclear)
    - year and month only (if the day is unclear)
    - full date
    - full date with time, including time zone.

Time and time zone information are not obligatory, but if a time value is added, time zone should also be recorded. If no time zone is added, the software should supply a default value.

NOTE: Exif currently does not hold time zone information in its time stamp. A time zone must be entered when importing Exif time information into an XMP field. Most software will apply the local time zone of the receiving computer system, so this should be checked if the image was created in a different time zone.

=== Metadata values shown multiple times

Some values may appear multiple times within software panels or tabs. This data is stored in only one location in the image file, but appears in the tabs for different schemas which use it as a ‘shared field'. 

For example, in Adobe products data entered in the IPTC Creator field also appears in the Author field in the Description Panel. If a change is made to the data in any tab or panel, that change is replicated in the other locations.

=== IPTC Photo Metadata and Google Images

Google has introduced a new feature of their “image search” mode in 2018. When an image is shown, one can click on “Image Credits” and a popup will show the image's creator, credit line and a copyright notice. It works by reading the corresponding embedded IPTC photo metadata fields from the image file. The name of the creator, the copyright notices and the credit line is shown.

IPTC is taking the opportunity to show the best way that each metadata field can be filled in based on the definitions in the standard.

==== What fields to use, and what to put in them 

Google displays three IPTC photo metadata fields, wherever available, for an image shown as search result. This tells the viewer who is the creator and who is the copyright holder of the image and what credit line should be shown next to the image. This information is taken from the IPTC photo metadata embedded in the image file.

Creator::
For displaying the creator of the image, the Creator field is read and shown with the label Creator. Google first reads the ISO XMP dc:creator field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2:80 Creator field. Your editing tool probably just gives you a single field labelled “creator” so just use that and you won't have to worry.
+
By its definition this field contains “the name of the photographer, but in cases where the photographer should not be identified the name of a company or organisation may be appropriate.”

Copyright Notice::
Google displays the Copyright Notice field (XMP dc:rights or IIM 2:116 Copyright Notice). So while you're tidying up your image metadata it makes sense to get this right too. The definition for this field is: “Contains any necessary copyright notice for claiming the intellectual property for artwork or an object in the image and should identify the current owner of the copyright of this work with associated intellectual property rights.” The format can differ according to the relevant copyright legislation of different countries. Again, Google first reads the ISO XMP dc:rights field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2.116 Copyright notice field.

Credit Line::
The Credit Line field (XMP photoshop:Credit or IIM 2:110 Credit) is used as “the credit to person(s) and/or organisation(s) required by the supplier of the image to be used when published.” Generally this would be a line of text that the supplier expects users of the image (such as Google Images) to display to users alongside the image. Again, Google first reads the ISO XMP photoshop:credit field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2.110 Credit field.
+
Most tools label this field as “Credit Line” in the editing interface, but some tools call it simply “Credit”.

==== For photo creators and editors: how to edit the metadata fields

It's important to understand that IPTC Photo Metadata is actually embedded in the image binary file. You can't add HTML tags or schema.org markup to add this metadata. But never fear - there are some tools you can use to edit the fields.

We maintain a list of tools for editing IPTC Photo Metadata. Here are a few of the major tools we cover there:

* Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom
* Photographer tools such as FotoStation, PhotoMechanic, ACDSee Pro and the Digital Asset Management system Extensis Portfolio
* For the more technical, the command-line ExifTool can be run in a script to update many images at the same time.

Each of these tools will allow you to edit fields a slightly different way. Usually there is some kind of “properties panel” or “metadata window” that lets you view and edit all embedded metadata fields.

==== For developers and site administrators: how to ensure the fields are preserved in images on your site

Your site's digital asset management system, content management system, image management system or content delivery network may be stripping out embedded metadata fields. Some systems do this with the best of intentions, thinking that it will save a few bytes of bandwidth, but stripping out metadata actually infringes on the copyright holders' rights and may even be illegal in some countries.

You should use a DAM and CMS that respects and conserves IPTC and XMP embedded metadata, and ensure that any configuration options that strip out metadata are turned off. Also you may need to look at image cropping and manipulation plugins for your CMS - for example the ImageMagick WordPress library retains embedded metadata, but some others strip it out.

=== [[digitalsourcetype]]Guidance for using Digital Source Type

The DigitalSourceType field and its corresponding controlled vocabulary https://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype
were originally added to the IPTC Photo Metadata Standard in 2008. The original goal was to represent the various
sources of a digital image such as a scan from print, a film negative or from positive film (also known as slide,
reversal or transparency film), or a direct capture from a digital camera.

In the first version of the vocabulary, there was a single term, "Created by Software" (softwareImage) which covered
all forms of image created using a computer.

In 2022, with the proliferation of generative AI and "synthetic media" systems, the vocabulary was extended to
include a more complete list of the different ways in which content might be created by or with the help of computer
software.

The vocabulary can also be used to describe other media we created the definitions so that they can equally apply to
video, audio or text.

This table describes each of the terms and definitions, along with some examples of the kinds of content intended to
be tagged with each category:

=== Guideline for mapping Category Codes to Subject NewsCodes

Early versions of IIM included the Datasets 2:15 “Category” and 2:20 “Supplemental Category”. But these two fields were replaced in IIM version 4 (released in 1999) by the Dataset 2:12 “Subject Reference” which must be populated by values from the IPTC Subject NewsCodes controlled vocabulary. In version 4 of the IIM specification document the Datasets Category and Supplemental Category were indicated as “deprecated” which meant that after the time of this release these two Datasets should not be populated with values any longer.

To support the move from the three letter codes used with the Category Dataset to the Subject NewsCodes this table provides a reference for mapping.

=== IPTC recommendation for metadata about composite images

Definition: a composite image is an image that is made from multiple images.

IPTC is asked how metadata about the different images the final image is made of could be expressed in a way which strictly links a metadata value to one of the source images.

IPTC recommends this procedure:

.	Create a thumbnail of the final image and draw lines along the edges between the different photos it was made of. Then apply a number to each region representing a photo. 
.	Assign numbers to the images making the composite photo: start at the left upper corner of the composite picture, go from left to right and from top to bottom. As soon as you encounter pixels from “another” image assign the next number from a sequence starting with 1. If the same source image is used for multiple regions of the composite image then apply the same number to all of them.
.	Make this thumbnail available on the web. Add the URL of this thumbnail to the Instructions field: the added string should be “composite reference http://....”. 
+
The rule for finding this link is: parse the Instructions field, any URL right after the words “composite reference” is the link to this thumbnail.
.	Prefix metadata about such a part-image with the assigned number of the reference thumbnail in square brackets. E.g. [1] …. [2] …. Metadata about the whole composite image should be prefixed with [0]

Example for the Creator field: [0] Giorgio Tintoretto [1] John Hopper [2] Pierre Monet [3] Franz Haas

=== IIM Metadata deprecated in IPTC Core

Some of the IIM metadata properties adopted by Adobe for the Photoshop File Info have not been carried forward into the IPTC Core schema. Data in these deprecated fields remains in the IIM header of the image, but will not be shown in IPTC Core compliant software.

The following fields from the IIM schema are deprecated in the IPTC Core schema, but are synchronised with XMP properties, and available for future use, but outside the IPTC Core. 

Urgency::
is used for distribution management and is synchronised with the XMP field ‘photoshop:Urgency'

*Category* and *Supplemental Category*::
were deprecated and merged to form the later Subject Newscodes. See the this guideline for mapping Category Codes to the newer Subject Newscodes.

These two properties are synchronised with XMP properties ‘photoshop:Category' and ‘photoshop:SupplementalCategories'. 

== Metadata Usage Examples

These examples provide entries for most of the IPTC Core and Extension fields for three uses cases, see the list below.

These are examples of use of metadata and are not prescriptive. In-house rules for use of metadata differ, but we would like to encourage metadata use in line with IPTC semantics.

|Description|This statue of the 16th President of the United States depicts a 19 foot high seated Abraham Lincoln in contemplation inside the Lincoln Memorial. It was carved of Georgia white marble by the Piccirilli Brothers under the supervision of the sculptor, Daniel Chester French and took four years to create, and completed in 1920.
|Alt Text (Accessibility)|Closeup of the Lincoln Memorial statue with Abraham Lincoln’s face and hand in view. Lincoln looks off with a steady expression, his hand curled into a loose fist resting on the arm of a large classical chair.
|Extended Description (Accessibility) |Lincoln is depicted with deep-set eyes, a strong browline, prominent cheekbones, short wavy hair, and a close beard. Two creases extend down at an angle from his nose to his lower cheekbones. His fixed gaze is directed slightly upward, mouth set in a straight line. His wrist is resting on the edge of the chair, held out straight so we see the bony knuckles of his hand.

|Alt Text (Accessibility)|Painting of a young girl posing for a portrait with a cat curled up in her lap.
|Extended Description (Accessibility) |She wears a dark gold dress with a low scooped neckline and short sleeves that are pinned up in front and draping down to her elbow. She looks at us with a serene expression, full rosy cheeks, pale skin, dark brown eyes, and a small pink mouth curling up slightly at the corners. Her hands delicately cradle the brown and black striped cat in her lap, one hand resting on its back and the other positioned close to its chest beside its head. The cat looks relaxed, perhaps sleepy, with its head tilted slightly towards the girl’s arm.

|Description|Little Children on a Bicycle, 2012 mural by Lithuanian artist Ernest Zacharevic in George Town, Penang, Malaysia.
|Alt Text (Accessibility)|A realist street art wall mural of two life-size children positioned to appear as if they are riding an actual bicycle that is parked on a city sidewalk.
|Extended Description (Accessibility) |The older child appears to be sitting on the seat of the black bicycle reaching towards the curved handlebars and looking out ahead with a joyous expression on their face. The younger child appears to be perched on the top of the back bicycle rack, hugging their arms tightly around the other’s waist and opening their mouth wide as if to scream. The distressed muted colors in the mural blend with the weathered gray and black patina stone wall and cracked sidewalk.
