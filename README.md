## Building from source

Install asciidoctor by following the instructions for your environment at https://asciidoctor.org/.

Run the script:
    ./asciidoctor-to-html.sh

The script should create a file at `index.html`.

## Current status

Work in progress. We are converting the Help version currently at
https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/documentation/userguide/
into an Asciidoctor version. We also plan to create translations in several languages.
